;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;;; The purpose of this package is to provide a default content for
;;; files. It extends the autoinsert package from Charlie Martin and
;;; took the idea of expanding parameters as in auto-template from
;;; Kevin Broadey (as suggested by Cedric Beust). It also allows to
;;; specify the initial position of the dot.

;;; Whenever an unexistent file is visited, its initial content can be
;;; specified by a parameterized template stored in the directory
;;; dc-auto-insert-directory or by explicit evaluation of some
;;; specified forms. A single undo removes all this initialization.

;;; To use it, add to your .emacs (taking care of load-path)
;;;          (require 'defaultcontent)
;;; and it is ready (try to open the empty foobar.el file for example).

;;; Repository:

;;; Newer versions will be sent to the LCD Archive but may appear earlier
;;; on http://youpou.lip6.fr/queinnec/Miscellaneous/
;;; Other Emacs packages in:
;;;    http://youpou.lip6.fr/queinnec/WWW/elisp.html

;;; Code:

;;; Indicate where you store the default content of files.
