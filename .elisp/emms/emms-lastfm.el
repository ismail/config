;;; Commentary:

;; This code sends information about what music you are playing to last.fm.
;; See <URL:http://www.last.fm> and
;; <URL:http://www.audioscrobbler.net/wiki/Protocol1.1>.

;;; Sample configuration:

;; (setq emms-lastfm-username "my-user-name"
;;       emms-lastfm-password "very-secret!")

;;; Usage:

;; To activate the last.fm emms plugin, run:
;;   `M-x emms-lastfm-enable'

;; Now all music you listen to will be submitted to Last.fm to enhance your
;; profile.

;; To deactivate the last.fm emms plugin, run:
;;   `M-x emms-lastfm-disable'

;; Beside submitting the tracks you listen to, you can also listen to Last.fm
;; radio. Simply copy the lastfm:// URL and run & paste:
;;   `M-x emms-lastfm-radio RET lastfm://artist/Britney Spears/fans'
;; (Of course you don't need to use _this_ URL. :-))

;; You can also insert Last.fm streams into playlists (or use
;; emms-streams.el to listen to them) by activating the player as
;; follows.
;;   (add-to-list 'emms-player-list 'emms-player-lastfm-radio)
;; To insert a Last.fm stream into a playlist, do
;;   (emms-insert-lastfm "lastfm://rest-of-url")

;; There are some functions for conveniently playing the Similar Artists and
;; the Global Tag Radio. Here you only need to enter the band's name or the tag
;; respectively.
;;   `M-x emms-lastfm-radio-similar-artists RET Britney Spears'
;;   `M-x emms-lastfm-radio-global-tag RET pop'

;; When you're listening to a Last.fm radio station you have the possibility to
;; give feedback to them. If you like the current song, type
;;   `M-x emms-lastfm-radio-love'.
;; If it's not that good, or it just happens to not fit to your actual mood,
;; type
;;   `M-x emms-lastfm-radio-skip'
;; and this song will be skipped.
;; If you really hate that song and you never want to hear it again, ban it by
;; typing
;;   `M-x emms-lastfm-radio-ban'.

;;; TODO
;;
;; - Get the last.fm radio stuff right again.  Currently the rating stuff seems
;;   to be broken.  There seems to be no official API, so one needs to look
;;   into the sources of the official client which can be found at
;;   http://www.audioscrobbler.net/development/client/.
